		VixenGL is a game engine I'm building, made to replicate the look and feel of 90s shooters like Duke Nukem, Blood (1997) and Doom. It started as a basic 3D Software Renderer, but I rewrote it to use OpenGL so it works better
		on modern hardware. It has a base engine, game loader and a level editor. All still WIP. <br> <br>
		Here are some key features:
		<ul>
		<li>Shader effects to look software-rendered</li>
		<li>Billboarded Sprites/Sprite sheets</li>
		<li>Source-style controls</li>
		<li>Maps build with Walls/Sectors/Portals</li>
		<li>Level Editor built in-engine, with ImDearGUI for UI and undoing/redoing.</li>
		<li>3D preview in the level editor, and textured floors in 2D view</li>
		<li>Zlib for loading from ZIP archive for game content</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
		<a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/12334109280/Guts-Blackpowder">Guts and Blackpowder</a> is a game I made with the Roblox Engine and is published to Roblox. As of writing this, the game has over 23 million overall plays, and gains an average of 2000 concurrent players. 
		I am the lead scripter on this project, and the project lead. 
		<br>
		Guts and Blackpowder is a game set during the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815). It is a FPS/TPS zombie game. The challenge of the game comes from the setting in 19th century Europe. You must use muskets, sabres, cannons, axes and many more weapons
		to beat the undead. The game has two modes <i>Endless</i> and <i>Objective</i>. 
		<br><br>
		Biggest Contributions I've made to the game:
		<ul>
		<li>All AI in the game (zombie types). Including decision-making, prediction, player interaction, and etc.</li>
		<li>Main game manager for both modes</li>
		<li>Weapon framework for all the guns, instruments, and other tools</li>
		<li>Optimized Potentially-Visible-Set for deciding where to spawn things throughout a level as it is played</li>
		<li>Manage of team of 5 other developers and 14 Contributors</li>
		<li>Researching period-accurate uniforms, hats and other clothing</li>
		</ul>

		Hooked is a game that I made with 3 other teammates for our college midstone project at Humber. I was the lead programmer for this project. The game is a simple fishing game based off the fishing minigame from The Legend of Zelda : Link's Awakening.
		We worked on it over a semester (~3 months). It was written in C++ from scratch in SDL2.

		I was responsible for:
		</p>

		<li>Game engine architecture</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Base Game class</li>
		<li>Game States / Scenes</li>
		<li>Input handler</li>

		<article id="game">
		<p>
		Bloodpowder is a game I made for the 2022 Global Game Jam and Humber Game Jam in 48 hours. The theme of the jam was Duality. The main mechanic of this game is that your character's health and the ammo in your gun are linked.
		Meaning if you shoot your gun, you lose health. Having no ammo in your gun would be a gameover. Ammo/Health can be picked up from dead enemies. The objective of the game is just to survive for as long as possible.
		<br><br>
		This game was built on an old version of my Vixen engine. It is software rendered, and there's an issue with the rendering but I couldn't fix it in time for the deadline.
		<br>
		If you wish to play it, you can find it on Itch.io <a href="https://fezezen.itch.io/bloodpowder">here</a>
		<br><br>
		I worked on this game alone, so I was responsible for everything:
		<ul>
		<li>Base game engine/Software renderer</li>
		<li>Weapon logic</li>
		<li>Character movement</li>
		<li>Animated Billboarded sprites</li>
		<li>Pre-rendered Enemy model (made in Blender)</li>
		<li>Raycasting between sectors to hit enemies</li>

		It Feasts on Gibs is a game I made for the <a href="https://ludumdare.com/">Ludum Dare 46 Game Jam</a> in 48 hours, the theme was "Keep it alive". It's built in the Love2D game framework. In the game you are the owner of a giant monster and you must feed it to maintain its health.
		If it dies, the game is over. Waves of zombies come after you, and you have to blast them into tiny pieces to be fed to your monster. Your character can also be hurt by the zombies, and obviously if you die, the game is over.

		<article id="game">
		<p>
		At Humber College I made a game engine for the game engine 4 course, built completely from scratch without the template code given by the professor. Here I learned how to make an Entity-Component/Unity style game object class.
		An Entity can have children entities, and each Entity can have various Components. Like a Transform, Mesh, Material, Shader, or Bone. This engine has a transform hierarchy, meaning a child entity inherits the transform of its parent. 
		Using this I was able to load entire models/scenes from many different model formats like FBX, OBJ, and COLLADA using the <a href="https://github.com/assimp/assimp">ASSIMP library</a> and implement skinned meshing. It loads the armature
		from the file, and you are able to translate, rotate and scale bones to affect the mesh they are skinned to.

		<article id="game">
		<p>
		For a college assignment I challenged myself to writing a game in something I'm less familiar with. So I wrote a game in C from scratch. Not C++, just C, compiled with MinGW/gcc. I made a clone of the game Defender (1981) where you fly a space ship
		over terrain and you must defend humanoids from being abducted by alien spaceships. I wrote this game in 12 hours over 2 days. The main challenge of C came from no STD library and the lack of native Object Oriented Programming.
		<br><br>
		Art was sourced from <a href="https://opengameart.org/">OpenGameArt.org</a>
		<br><br>
		Main features:
		<ul>
		<li>Space Ship Controls and physics</li>
		<li>Human physics and pick-up logic for both aliens and the player</li>
		<li>Alien lander AI that targets humans and flies off with them</li>
		<li>Spawning logic that scales as the game progresses</li>
		<li>Projectiles for shooting aliens</li>
		<li>Repeating terrain</li>
